# sql_project

In the fast-paced world of e-commerce, businesses generate large volumes of transactional and customer data daily. However, without proper analysis, this data remains underutilized. The goal of this project is to analyze various aspects of an e-commerce platform using SQL to extract actionable insights that can support business decisions. These include understanding customer behavior, product performance, sales trends, and payment efficiency.

ðŸ“„ Brief Information of the Project
This project focuses on analyzing a simulated e-commerce database using SQL. The database consists of five interconnected tables:

Customers â€“ Stores customer information such as name, email, region, and signup date.

Products â€“ Contains product details including name, category, and price.

Orders â€“ Records order transactions with total purchase amount and order date.

Order Items â€“ Breaks down each order into individual product items and quantities.

Payments â€“ Tracks payment method and payment status for each order.

Using SQL queries, the project is divided into three levels:

ðŸ”¹ Basic Level: Covers simple SELECT statements, filtering, and basic aggregations.

ðŸ”¹ Intermediate Level: Involves JOIN operations, grouping, and conditional aggregations.

ðŸ”¹ Advanced Level: Utilizes subqueries, common table expressions (CTEs), and analytical functions to generate deeper business insights.

Through this project, key performance metrics such as total revenue, top customers, payment success rates, and product rankings are derived, providing a holistic view of business operations.
